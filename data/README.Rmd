`timbr-clinical-results.rds` was created with code in `Rmd/clinical-timbr.Rmd`.

Rick Baker emailed me the two csv files on Oct 23, 2019.

* On Nov 21, 2019, I hand-transcribed the file "v2_byhand_hotspot_tnseq_traits.csv" from the html file "hotspot_allele_effects2.html"

## Derived traits

Clare emailed a csv file with "derived" traits on Jan 6, 2020. I don't right now know the methods by which these traits were derived.

The traits are in the file "CC_clust_tomap.csv".

## Eigentraits

I added the file 'eigenvectors.csv' to the data subdir on Jan 8, 2020. It contains eigentraits that Chris shared via email.
