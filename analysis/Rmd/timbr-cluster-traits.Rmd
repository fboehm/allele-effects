## From Rick's email

> Iâ€™d be interested in getting TIMBR results for some of our recent cluster mappings. If you have the time, I attached mapping results and a phenotype matrix. The traits of interest are yellow and black (with suffix .allScoresWin).

## Read the csv files

```{r}
es_w <- readr::read_csv("../data/pheno679_eigenscores_from_WGCNA_unsigned.csv")
peaks <- readr::read_csv("../data/pheno679_eigenscores_unsigned_maxLOD_peaks.csv")
```
